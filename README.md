# Restaurant inspections

This is a collection of scrapers to scrape restaurant health inspection data from multiple cities around Dallas as inspections occur. The end goal is to scrape all cities in Dallas and Tarrant Counties.

Then the scraped data will be exported as Django models and imported into a searchable database.


## An important note

**This code is unlicensed** â€” that is, it has not been licensed for use outside _The Dallas Morning News_. The scrapers and UI included here are pre-release versions, and are primarily published here to showcase the significant contribution our former intern [Carlie Procell](https://github.com/qbscarlie) has made to this project. Future releases of this data (and a public-facing UI) will be forthcoming.
